Recall the differences between a ResultProxy and a ResultSet:

ResultProxy: The object returned by the .execute() method. It can be used in a variety of ways to get the data returned by the query.
ResultSet: The actual data asked for in the query when using a fetch method such as .fetchall() on a ResultProxy.

---------------
# Get the first row of the results by using an index: first_row
first_row = results[0]

# Print the first row of the results
print(first_row)

# Print the first column of the first row by accessing it by its index
print(first_row[0])

# Print the 'state' column of the first row by using its name
print(first_row['state'])

Applying Filtering, Ordering and Grouping to Queries


# Create a select query: stmt
stmt = select([census])

# Add a where clause to filter the results to only those for New York : stmt_filtered
stmt = stmt.where(census.columns.state=='New York')

# Execute the query to retrieve all the data returned: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# Loop over the results and print the age, sex, and pop2000
for result in results:
    print(result.age, result.sex, result.pop2000)


------
# Define a list of states for which we want results
states = ['New York', 'California', 'Texas']

# Create a query for the census table: stmt
stmt = select([census])

# Append a where clause to match all the states in_ the list states
stmt = stmt.where(census.columns.state.in_(states))

# Loop over the ResultProxy and print the state and its population in 2000
for result in connection.execute(stmt):
    print(result.state, result.pop2000)

-----
# Import and_
from sqlalchemy import and_

# Build a query for the census table: stmt
stmt = select([census])

# Append a where clause to select only non-male records from California using and_
stmt = stmt.where(
    # The state of California with a non-male sex
    and_(census.columns.state == 'California',
         census.columns.sex != 'M'
         )
)

# Loop over the ResultProxy printing the age and sex
for result in connection.execute(stmt):
    print(result.age, result.sex)

-------
# Build a query to select the state column: stmt
stmt = select([census.columns.state])

# Order stmt by the state column
stmt = stmt.order_by(census.columns.state)

# Execute the query and store the results: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# Print the first 10 results
print(results[:10])

-----
# Import desc
from sqlalchemy import desc

# Build a query to select the state column: stmt
stmt = select([census.columns.state])

# Order stmt by state in descending order: rev_stmt
rev_stmt = stmt.order_by(desc(census.columns.state))

# Execute the query and store the results: rev_results
rev_results = connection.execute(rev_stmt).fetchall()

# Print the first 10 rev_results

# Build a query to select state and age: stmt
stmt = select([census.columns.state, census.columns.age])

# Append order by to ascend by state and descend by age

# Print the first 20 results

------
# Build a query to count the distinct states values: stmt
stmt = select([func.count(census.columns.state.distinct())])

# Execute the query and store the scalar result: distinct_state_count
distinct_state_count = connection.execute(stmt).scalar()

-----
# Import func
from sqlalchemy import func

# Build a query to select the state and count of ages by state: stmt

# Import func

# Build an expression to calculate the sum of pop2008 labeled as population
